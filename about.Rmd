Hi there! My name is Mengyu (Mary) Yu. I am graduating from Georgetown University's M.S. in Data Science and Analytics this December. I went to undergrad at Miami University in Oxford, OH, and majored in Statistics. I also minored in Math, Computer Science, and 2D Media Studies. I have a 4-year-old cat Bobbie, who I adopted from a shelter in 2017. On the professional side, I enjoy visualizing, analyzing and modeling data to help audiences from all backgrounds understand the stories that lie within the data. On a more personal side, I love painting (oil and watercolor), printmaking, and playing tennis.

Feel free to contact me at my537@georgetown.edu.

Welcome to my ANLY 503 Portfolio! This portfolio consists of some of my assignments, as well as my final data visualization project. 

Feel free to explore the tabs to see examples of different types of plots. I am a `ggplot` lover, therefore the majority of the plots are made in R. 

Data visualization is a very interesting topic. For me it is one of the best ways to combine my profession with my hobbies. I love painting, drawing, and creating data vizs allow me to keep pursuing for a higher level of aesthetics while still being able to tell stories about the data. It's clear that there are more limitations to data visualizations than pure arts, but I will keep looking for ways to create high-quality visualizations that also brings visual enjoyments.
